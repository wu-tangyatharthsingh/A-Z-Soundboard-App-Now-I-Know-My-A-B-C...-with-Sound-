## 🖥️ About the Project

This project is a colorful, interactive **A–Z soundboard** created using Python.  
Click any alphabet button, and you'll hear that letter's sound.

It combines:
- GUI design (`tkinter`)
- Sound effects (`pygame`)
- Random color styling
- Background image using `Pillow`

It's a beginner-friendly project meant to sharpen Python skills while creating something fun and visual.

## 📚 What I Learned

As a computer science student, this project helped me learn:

- How to create a GUI using `tkinter`
- How to play `.mp3` files using `pygame.mixer`
- How to work with images using `Pillow (PIL)`
- How to loop through the alphabet using `string` module
- How to assign random colors to UI elements
- How to make my Python code more efficient using loops and lambdas

This was a hands-on way to understand how different Python modules work together in a real project.
