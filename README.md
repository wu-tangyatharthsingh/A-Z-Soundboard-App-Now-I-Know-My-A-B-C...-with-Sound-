# A-Z-Soundboard-App-Now-I-Know-My-A-B-C...-with-Sound-
This is a fun and interactive Tkinter-based soundboard where each letter from A to Z plays a unique sound. Each button is randomly colored and laid out beautifully over a custom background. Built using Python, this project helped me learn and apply several important concepts!
